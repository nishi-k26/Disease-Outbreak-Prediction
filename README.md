# Disease Outbreak Prediction

Welcome to the Disease Outbreak Prediction project! This repository contains code for predicting disease outbreaks across the states of India. The project leverages machine learning models to analyze historical data and forecast future outbreaks.

## Features
- Predict disease outbreaks by state
- Analyze historical trends
- Scalable and modular code structure

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
